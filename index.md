### About Me

Hi! My name is **Jiayi Xu 徐嘉艺**. Currently, I am a second-year Master's student in **Statistics & Operations Research** at UNC-Chapel Hill.

My research interest focus on bidirectional influence in human-AI collaboration:

* **AI➜Human**: How AI shapes human emotion, cognition, and decision-making process.
* **Human➜AI**: How cultural values and social norms from human society are embedded in AI and affect their behavior and applications.
