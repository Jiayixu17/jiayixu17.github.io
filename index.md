### About Me

My research interest focus on bidirectional influence in human-AI collaboration:

* **AI➜Human**: How AI shapes human emotion, cognition, and decision-making process.
* **Human➜AI**: How cultural values and social norms from human society are embedded in AI and affect their behavior and applications.
